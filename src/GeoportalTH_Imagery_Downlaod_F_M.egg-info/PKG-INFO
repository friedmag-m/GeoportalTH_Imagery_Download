This package allows the user to download Digital Elevation Models and Orthophotos 
from a specified year within a specified area. The Tool utilises several python packages
which need to be installed e.g. by setting up an anaconda environment with the provided YAML

preferably a ESRI shapefile. No specific directories need to be setup as they will be 
setup automatically by the tool. This tool can be used as an implementation for other 
applications by importing it. When executing the tool as a script, the execution 
parameters should be specified within the if __name__ == "__main__" statement.
